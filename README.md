## Angular (7.x): Some Introductory Notes

- angular-cli: "batteries included"
  -- Significant difference vs. React - think of Django's CLI, or Laravel's or RoR.

- Nrwl workspace
- Angular Material

-- on top of setting up dev server etc., you can create schematics that let people auto-generate projects based on a schematic.

## Getting started

```
npm i -g @angular/cli@9
npm i -g @nrwl/nx
npm i -g @nrwl/cli
npm i -g @nrwl/schematics
npx create-nx-workspace angular-core-workshop
```

It splits into applications and reusable component libraries.

`cd angular-core-workshop/`
`npm start`
